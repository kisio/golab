## Running the Examples

Each directory contains Go files with examples. To run an example:

1. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd <directory_name>
   ```

2. Run the Go file:
   ```bash
   go run <filename>.go
   ```

For example, to run the functions example:
```bash
cd functions
go run functions.go
```

Or for the numbered examples:
```bash
cd one
go run main.go
```
